Hello guys, I made want to make a 7-segment display. But this time with bigger digits and RGB effects. Because this can be used to display some readings like Clock with Nodemcu, temperature monitoring using Arduino. Also, with an option of color changing after each second or next reading. I also have the similar one, which I designed a while back. That design has some Led orientation problems.
Because last time I used 2 LED’s to display per segment, our eye can’t regonize the digits too fast and accurate. Means we need a focus; I am happy with the design but now it’s time for update. JLCPCB is always with me to provide good PCB prototype and SMT assembly service solutions. https://jlcpcb.com/SSR

I used JLCPCB SMT assembly service for these good looking PCBs, here is the full review of the SMT assembly service. White color PCB, 1.6mm thickness and HASL finish is looking pretty damn good with JLCPCB SMT Assembly service. These Boards are fully assembled by JLCPCB, means all the components and soldering work is done by them. Why not to try this offer, JLCPCB SMT assembly service is staring from $8 and if you sign-up using this link, you will get free coupons of worth $30 and newcomer rewards.

Troubleshooting:
1) Din is always connected to Dout in series with on e another, if connected in opposite or disconnected from anywhere whole setup stops working.
2) Connect the Dash as shown in figure above.
3) Make sure all the connections are properly soldered, dry soldering will cause change in data value and color.
4) Don't heat the PCB too much, while Soldering and keep the temperature on 300*c.
